You are a senior software engineer analyzing a log statement from source code.

## Context
- **Programming Language:** {language}
- **Log Template:** {log_template}
- **File Location:** {file_path}:{line_number}

## Code Context:
```
{code_context}
```

## Task
Analyze this log statement and provide:

1. **Analysis** (1-2 concise sentences):
   - Explain WHY this log statement was written (the business/technical reason)
   - Describe WHAT CONDITION triggers this log to be emitted
   - Reference specific variable names or function calls from the code context where relevant
   - Focus on the developer's intent and the system's behavior

2. **Severity Classification**:
   Classify the log severity as one of:
   - **DEBUG**: Detailed diagnostic information for development/debugging
   - **INFO**: Informational messages about normal system operation
   - **WARNING**: Warning about potentially problematic situations that don't prevent operation
   - **ERROR**: Error events that might still allow the application to continue
   - **CRITICAL**: Severe errors that may cause the application to abort

3. **Suggested Action**:
   What should a developer or operator do when they see this log in production?
   - If it's purely informational with no action needed, respond with: null
   - Otherwise, provide a brief 1-sentence action (e.g., "Check database connectivity", "Verify user permissions", "Investigate recent configuration changes")

## Output Format
Respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code blocks, explanations, or any other text.

{{
  "analysis": "Your 1-2 sentence analysis explaining why this log exists and what triggers it",
  "severity": "INFO",
  "suggested_action": "Brief action to take, or null if none needed"
}}

## Important Guidelines
- Be concise but specific
- Reference actual code elements (variable names, function calls) from the context
- Severity should reflect the log level used in the code when possible
- For suggested_action, think from an operations/monitoring perspective
- Respond with ONLY the JSON object, nothing else
